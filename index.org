My academic background is in mathematics (M.Sc and B.Sc), but I also spent a few years studying linguistics and computer science. These days my interests are in more interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework][sense-making]]. I like learning about how mistakes get made (Kahneman, Taleb), and how problems get identified and placed in a framework ([[https://meaningness.com/eggplant][David Chapman]], [[https://everythingstudies.com/][John Nerst]]). For now I guess that makes me a data scientist.

* About
  
I grew up in southern Ontario, around Waterloo and then on a farm in Grey County, before pursing a Philosophy degree at the University of Ottawa --- which became a Linguistics Degree after I discovered [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct][Pinker's work]] --- which became a Computer Science Degree after discovering [[http://norvig.com/chomsky.html][Norvig's writing]] --- I eventually switched to math, finding that I enjoyed my peers there, and respected the rigor and beauty in the work. I ultimately finished with an undergrad and then a master's in math, but I often think about the quote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.  
 
    --- John von Neumann
#+END_QUOTE

I enjoy simplicity of math, and I think it's enriched the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor][collection of metaphors]] that I can approach problems with, but at the moment I am more interested in a broader conception of [[https://meaningness.com/eggplant][problem solving/framing]]. Data science is an interesting way to explore these sorts of problems and ideas.

** dynamical systems and probability theory

My mathematical interests were/are in ergodic theory of discrete systems and symbolic dynamics. My master's thesis was on the Benjamini-Schramm limit (a distributional limit for graphs) of Rauzy graphs of low-complexity singly-infinite words, where I worked on identifying the subsequential Benjamini-Schramm limits with shift-invariant probability measures the associated two-sided symbolic system associated to a word. I showed that when the word has uniform frequencies, the Benjamini-Schramm limit exists, because there is a single shift-invariant measure (the system is uniquely ergodic in this case). I also provided partial results and showed the pathology of the non-uniquely ergodic case. I was supervised by Dr. Vadim Kaimanovich. /I successfully defended my thesis on August 7, 2019./ The ideas are connected to theory of de Bruijn graphs ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5531759/][Why are de Bruijn graphs useful for genome assembly?]]) and their statistical properties (their invariant measures). This work was part of a larger research program in [[https://www.math.u-psud.fr/Stochastic-homogenization-and-dynamics?lang=fr][stochastic homogenization and dynamics]].

* Hobbies
** scbursts
I am also the author and maintainer of an [[https://github.com/dacostalab/scbursts][R package]] written for the [[https://www.dacosta.net/][dacosta lab]] for assisting with the analysis of single-ion channel experiments. Available on [[https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scbursts][CRAN]]. I am the principal author of [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019300810][an open-access paper published on it]].

** free software
I'm also a hobbyist programmer who likes linux, [[https://www.fsf.org/][free-software]], and functional programming (particularly [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]]). I've been using linux for about 10 years. I have a patch on [[https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/message/][suckless.org]] for a screen-locker for linux. I'm also a big fan of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]].

Here's a snippet of Haskell code for finding all ring automorphisms of Mat_{2x2}(Z). [[./files/automorphisms.hs][Haskell example.]]

If you want a 170+ random scripts that I wrote, I have those too! [[https://github.com/blairdrummond/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/bin][My scripts]]
** fun
I also enjoy magical realist fiction (Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges), funk+jazz music ([[https://vulfpeck.com/][Vulfpeck]], [[http://azymuth.net][Azymuth]], and [[http://snarkypuppy.com/][Snarky Puppy]]), and cycling.

A fun excerpt from Hadamard's Essay "The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Indeed, it is obvious that invention or discovery, be it in mathematics or anywhere else, takes place by combining ideas.^1

1. Max Müller observes that the Latin verb "cogito," for "to think," etymologically means "to shake together." St. Augustine had already noticed that and also observed that "intelligo" means to "select among," in a curious connection with what we say in the text.
