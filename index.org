My academic background is in mathematics (M.Sc and B.Sc) --specifically analysis and probability on graphs-- but I also spent a few years studying linguistics and computer science. These days my interests are in more interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework][sense-making]]. I like learning about how mistakes get made (Kahneman, Taleb), [[https://everythingstudies.com/2018/04/26/a-deep-dive-into-the-harris-klein-controversy/][why reasonable people disagree]] and [[https://meaningness.com/eggplant][how problems get identified and placed in a framework]]. I also enjoy thinking about algorithms, workflows, and computation, so for now that makes me a data scientist! I am also very interested in learning more about random walks and spectral graph theory, random graphs, time-series analysis, and  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis][social network analysis]] --- including applications to:

- [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02562-z][Filter bubbles & Gerrymandering]]
- [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10478][Online dating and random graphs]]
- As well as twitter, fake news, and virality.
  
I would also like to spend more time reading the stuff [[http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/][Cosma Shalizi]] has written. (also at [[http://www.bactra.org/][bactra]])

* About
  
I grew up in Kitchener, Ontario, and then on a farm in Grey County, before pursing a philosophy degree at the University of Ottawa... which became a linguistics degree after I discovered [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct][Pinker's work]]... which became a computer science degree after discovering NLP and [[http://norvig.com/chomsky.html][Norvig's writing]]... which ultimately became a math degree. I found that I enjoyed my peers in mathematics, and I felt at home amongst a group of people who weren't afraid of hard work to figure out "but why is it like that?" 

I ultimately finished(?) with a B.Sc and an M.Sc in math, but I often think about the quote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.  
 
    --- John von Neumann
#+END_QUOTE

I enjoy beauty and simplicity of math, and I think it's enriched the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor][collection of metaphors]] that I can approach problems with, but at the moment I am more interested in a broader conception of [[https://meaningness.com/eggplant][problem solving/framing]]. Data science is an interesting way to explore these sorts of problems and ideas.

** dynamical systems and probability theory

My mathematical interests were/are in ergodic theory of discrete systems and symbolic dynamics. [[https://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/39594][My master's thesis]] was on the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0011019][Benjamini-Schramm limit]] (a distributional limit for graphs) of Rauzy graphs (subgraphs of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph][de Bruijn graphs]]) of low-complexity singly-infinite words. I worked on identifying the subsequential Benjamini-Schramm limits with shift-invariant probability measures on the two-sided symbolic system associated to an infinite word. 

#+CAPTION: The third Rauzy graph of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence][Thue-Morse word]], 0110100110010110...
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300 :height 300 :class blackwhite
[[./files/thue-morse-3.png]]

I showed that when the word has /uniform frequencies/, the Benjamini-Schramm limit exists, because there is a single shift-invariant measure (the system is uniquely ergodic in this case). I also provided partial results and showed that in the non-uniquely ergodic case that the limit may or may not exist, with examples and counter-examples. I was supervised by Dr. Vadim Kaimanovich. /I successfully defended my thesis on August 7, 2019./ The ideas are connected to theory of de Bruijn graphs ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5531759/][Why are de Bruijn graphs useful for genome assembly?]], and [[HTT_HTH][hitting times of patterns with overlap]]) and their statistical properties (their invariant measures). This work was part of a larger research program in [[https://www.math.u-psud.fr/Stochastic-homogenization-and-dynamics?lang=fr][stochastic homogenization and dynamics]].

* Hobbies
** scbursts
I am also the author and maintainer of an [[https://github.com/dacostalab/scbursts][R package]] written for the [[https://www.dacosta.net/][dacosta lab]] for assisting with the analysis of single-ion channel experiments. The library is available on [[https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scbursts][CRAN]]. I am also the principal author of [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019300810][an open-access paper published on it]].

** free software
I've also been a hobbyist programmer (and later a professional programmer) who likes linux, [[https://www.fsf.org/][free-software]], and functional programming (particularly [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]]). I've been using linux for about 10 years. I have a patch on [[https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/message/][suckless.org]] for a screen-locker for linux. I'm also a big fan of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]].

Here's a snippet of Haskell code for finding all ring automorphisms of Mat_{2x2}(Z). [[./files/automorphisms.hs][Haskell example.]]

If you want a [[https://github.com/blairdrummond/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/bin][170+ random scripts]] that I wrote, I have those too! 

** fun
I also enjoy magical realist fiction (Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges), funk+jazz music ([[https://vulfpeck.com/][Vulfpeck]], [[http://azymuth.net][Azymuth]], and [[http://snarkypuppy.com/][Snarky Puppy]]), and cycling.

A fun excerpt from Hadamard's Essay "The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Indeed, it is obvious that invention or discovery, be it in mathematics or anywhere else, takes place by combining ideas.^1

1. Max Müller observes that the Latin verb "cogito," for "to think," etymologically means "to shake together." St. Augustine had already noticed that and also observed that "intelligo" means to "select among," in a curious connection with what we say in the text.

I was once an NLP research assistant in [[http://artsites.uottawa.ca/margento/en/the-graph-poem/][the digital humanities]], and I still think these projects are very cool.
